# booking_app

My first app made with Flutter, 'bookingapp' allows users to book and manage appointments for salons (& spas). This app was made during my co-op for my last semester of high school. If I decide to make this a summer project, this project will under-go some major code improvements and refactoring. But, I am proud of the outcome and will continue on this path.

## Features
* ✅ Allow users to book appointments
* ✅ Store booked appointments into Firebase
* ✅ Modern, simplistic UI design
* ✅ Lots of room for customization
* ✅ A lot of fail-safe code (null checks)


## TODO
* Improve/refactor some of the code.
* Reducing loading times, especially for slower connections.
* Add a little bit of colour to the UI; seems a little bit boring.
* Add more to the TODO...
